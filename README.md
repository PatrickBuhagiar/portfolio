# Welcome to my portfolio!
I've built this website entirely from scratch using HTML and SCSS. See the result at https://patrickbuhagiar.github.io/portfolio/!.
## Instructions
Execute `npm run start` and you're good to go. By defaultit will open up Firefox. Feel free to change thus in  `package.json`. 

For the productionised version, execute `npm run build:css` and open the `index.html` file.
